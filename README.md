# Text Classification with BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT using Simple Transformers

This project demonstrates how to perform text classification using BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT models with the Simple Transformers library. We will train and evaluate these models on a dataset of tweets to classify them as either "Real" or "Fake".

## Overview

Text classification is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the objective is to categorize text into predefined classes. In this project, we leverage powerful transformer-based models to achieve high accuracy in text classification.

### Simple Transformers

Simple Transformers is a Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for training and evaluating transformer models for various NLP tasks, including text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. It abstracts the complexity of model implementation, allowing you to focus on data preparation and experimentation.

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

BERT is a transformer-based model designed by Google that has significantly advanced the state of the art in many NLP tasks. It captures bidirectional context from surrounding words in a text, which helps in understanding the meaning of words based on their context.

### RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)

RoBERTa is a robustly optimized version of BERT developed by Facebook. It improves upon BERT by training with larger batches, more data, and removing the next sentence prediction objective. These modifications make RoBERTa more powerful and effective for various NLP tasks.

### ALBERT (A Lite BERT)

ALBERT is a lighter version of BERT that reduces the number of parameters to improve efficiency without sacrificing much performance. It achieves this through techniques like factorized embedding parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing, making it suitable for environments with limited computational resources.

In this project, we train and evaluate these models on a dataset of tweets and use the trained RoBERTa model for making predictions on new tweets. The goal is to compare the performance of these models and understand their strengths and weaknesses in the context of text classification.
